            <div class = "textR"> In a few months, I will be graduating from CCVI and starting my next life adventure, Computer Engineering.  
                Computer Engineering combines my passion for problem-solving using programming with hands-on designing and building my ideas. As  side projects, 
                I enjoy programming with Java and have mastered Python to win the Calysto Hackathon. Inspired by the COVID vaccine storage concerns, 
                my recent engineering prototype is a desktop fridge made from recycled materials that an Arduino regulates. Ultimately, my goal is to 
                combine my passions and education to become a founding member of a start-up creating technology that can improve society.  </div>

                    of Top 10 written exams in the Oral category and Provincial invites.
                    My most recent DECA experience in November was a Top 20 Ontario finish at Regionals.
